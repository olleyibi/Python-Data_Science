	# Function and methods
Functions can take in multiple arguments/objects
	eg.
		function_name(arguments/object)
		
Methods are applied at the end of a single object
	eg.
		object_name.method()

	# Index and slicing
Python position/index counts starts from '0' (zero)

	# Data type identification
Tuple = ()
List = []
Dictionary = {}

	# Class, Object, Attributes
Class: eg 								bike-maker, 		list class
Object/instance: eg 							bikes, 			list
attribute/properties: eg 						color, size, 		type(int,str,floats)
Method is like a cosequential sequence applied to an object
	eg
									.turn_left()		.extend()
									.turn_right()		.index()
