    "A batch size of 1 results in the SGD. It takes the algorithm very little time to process a single batch (as it is one data point), but there are thousands of batches (54000 to be precise), thus the algorithm is actually slow. Remember that this depends on the number of cores that you train on. If you are using a CPU with 4 or 8 cores, you can only train 4 or 8 batches at once. The middle ground (mini-batching such as 100 samples per batch) is optimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the validation accuracy starts from a high number. That's because there are **lots** updates in a single epoch. Once the training is over, the accuracy is lower than all other batch sizes (SGD was an approximation)."
