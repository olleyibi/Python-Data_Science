# Absenteeism
	The absence from work during normal working hours resulting in temporary incapacity to execute regular working activity.

# The Problem
	The problem is that the business environment of today is more competitive than it used to be. This leads to 
	increased pressure in the workplace. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that unachievable business goals 
	and an elevated risk of unemployment an raise people's stress levels.

	Often the continuous presence of such factors becomes detrimental to a person's health. Sometimes this may 
	result in minor illness, which of course is not desired. However, it may happen that the employee develops 
	a long term condition.
		An example being depression.
		
	* Based on what information should we predict whether an employee is expected to be absent or not?
	* How would we measure absenteeism?
	* Should we rather think about trying to predict excessive absenteeism?

# Perspective
	The problem will be solved from the point of view of the person in charge of productivity in the company
	We would like to know whether or not an employee can be expected to be missing for a specific number of 
		hours in a given workday.

# Purpose		
	Explore whether a person presenting certain characteristics is expected to be away from work at some point 
	in time or not. In other words, we want to know for how many working hours an employee could be away from 
	work based on information such as 
		* how far they live from their workplace, 
		* how many children and pets they have, 
		* do they have higher education and so on.......

# Dataset
	Based on the data set of an already existing study about the prediction of absenteeism at work.
